begin acl

# This access control list is used for every RCPT command in an incoming
# SMTP message. The tests are run in order until the address is either
# accepted or denied.

acl_check_rcpt:

  # Accept if the source is local SMTP (i.e. not over TCP/IP). We do this by
  # testing for an empty sending host field.

  accept  hosts = :
          control = dkim_disable_verify

  #############################################################################
  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # @ or % or ! or / or | or dots in unusual places.
  #
  # The characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine local parts, but
  # are often tried by people looking to circumvent relaying restrictions.
  # Therefore, although they are valid in local parts, these rules lock them
  # out, as a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # someone like me, who has no second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one is stricter, and is applied to
  # messages that are addressed to one of the local domains handled by this
  # host. The line "domains = +local_domains" restricts it to domains that are
  # defined by the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The rule  blocks
  # local parts that begin with a dot or contain @ % ! / or |. If you have
  # local accounts that include these characters, you will have to modify this
  # rule.

  deny    message       = Restricted characters in address
          domains       = +local_domains
          local_parts   = ^[.] : ^.*[@%!/|]

  # The second rule applies to all other domains, and is less strict. The line
  # "domains = !+local_domains" restricts it to domains that are NOT defined by
  # the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The exclamation mark is a
  # negating operator. This rule allows your own users to send outgoing
  # messages to sites that use slashes and vertical bars in their local parts.
  # It blocks local parts that begin with a dot, slash, or vertical bar, but
  # allows these characters within the local part. However, the sequence /../
  # is barred. The use of @ % and ! is blocked, as before. The motivation here
  # is to prevent your users (or your users' viruses) from mounting certain
  # kinds of attack on remote sites.

  deny    message       = Restricted characters in address
          domains       = !+local_domains
          local_parts   = ^[./|] : ^.*[@%!] : ^.*/\\.\\./

  # Accept mail to postmaster in any local domain, regardless of the source,
  # and without verifying the sender.

  accept  local_parts   = postmaster
          domains       = +local_domains

  # Deny unless the sender address can be verified.

  require verify        = sender

  # Accept if the message comes from one of the hosts for which we are an
  # outgoing relay. It is assumed that such hosts are most likely to be MUAs,
  # so we set control=submission to make Exim treat the message as a
  # submission. It will fix up various errors in the message, for example, the
  # lack of a Date: header line. If you are actually relaying out out from
  # MTAs, you may want to disable this. If you are handling both relaying from
  # MTAs and submissions from MUAs you should probably split them into two
  # lists, and handle them differently.

  # Recipient verification is omitted here, because in many cases the clients
  # are dumb MUAs that don't cope well with SMTP error responses. If you are
  # actually relaying out from MTAs, you should probably add recipient
  # verification here.

  # Note that, by putting this test before any DNS black list checks, you will
  # always accept from these hosts, even if they end up on a black list. The
  # assumption is that they are your friends, and if they get onto a black
  # list, it is a mistake.

          control       = dkim_disable_verify

  # Accept if the message arrived over an authenticated connection, from
  # any host. Again, these messages are usually from MUAs, so recipient
  # verification is omitted, and submission mode is set. And again, we do this
  # check before any black list tests.

  accept  authenticated = *
          control       = submission
          control       = dkim_disable_verify

  # Insist that any other recipient address that we accept is either in one of
  # our local domains, or is in a domain for which we explicitly allow
  # relaying. Any other domain is rejected as being unacceptable for relaying.

  require message = relay not permitted
          domains = +local_domains : +relay_to_domains

  # We also require all accepted addresses to be verifiable. This check will
  # do local part verification for local domains, but only check the domain
  # for remote domains. The only way to check local parts for the remote
  # relay domains is to use a callout (add /callout), but please read the
  # documentation about callouts before doing this.

  require verify = recipient

  # There are no default checks on DNS black lists because the domains that
  # contain these lists are changing all the time. However, here are two
  # examples of how you can get Exim to perform a DNS black list lookup at this
  # point. The first one denies, whereas the second just warns.
  #
  # deny    message       = rejected because $sender_host_address is in a black list at $dnslist_domain\n$dnslist_text

  # This check is commented out because it is recognized that not every
  # sysadmin will want to do it. If you enable it, the check performs
  # Client SMTP Authorization (csa) checks on the sending host. These checks
  # do DNS lookups for SRV records. The CSA proposal is currently (May 2005)
  # an Internet draft. You can, of course, add additional conditions to this
  # ACL statement to restrict the CSA checks to certain hosts only.

# Some suggested ways of configuring these tests are shown below, commented
# out. Without any tests, this ACL accepts all messages. If you want to use

# extension (WITH_CONTENT_SCAN=yes in Local/Makefile).
