begin retry

# This single retry rule applies to all domains and all errors. It specifies
# retries every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then increasing retry intervals,
# starting at 1 hour and increasing each time by a factor of 1.5, up to 16
# hours, then retries every 6 hours until 4 days have passed since the first
# failed delivery.

# WARNING: If you do not have any retry rules at all (this section of the
# configuration is non-existent or empty), Exim will not do any retries of
# messages that fail to get delivered at the first attempt. The effect will
# be to treat temporary errors as permanent. Therefore, DO NOT remove this
# retry rule unless you really don't want any retries.
